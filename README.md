## Background

This demo is a part of a doctoral research project. For a comprehensive understanding of the project, you can read the research paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ohLthgQ5QWRyC5iMCMRe_V---UiQnsa/view?usp=sharing) (in french). Additionally, if you're interested specifically in the feasibility study, it's available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvJ6es_IOjwLTdyjeZfOz6WQ6fG4rM81/view?usp=sharing) (in french).

## How to Run Locally

***Requirements: Node v18+, Angular CLI v13+***

$ npm install
$ ng serve
```
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser to view the project locally.

```
The backend code for this project is stored in a private repository. However, you can utilize the preprod environments as a backend to access data. Simply copy the content of environment.preprod.ts and replace the content of environment.ts.

### Basemaps

To integrate basemaps, you'll need your own MapTiler key. If you don't have one yet, log in to https://cloud.maptiler.com/ and create a new key in the `API Keys` tab. Then, paste the key in `mapTilerKey` variable in all your environments files.
